## Food Provision: Fisheries
Amount of sustainable wild-caught seafood compared to the reference multi-species max sustainable yield [$mMSY_{R}]

$$
x_{FIS} =  (1 - \frac{\delta{C_{t}}}{mMSY_{R}})
$$  

\[ \delta{C_{t}} = 
   \begin{cases}
    0                      &\quad \text{if }\ |{mMSY_{r}}-{C_{t}}| < {{0.05}*{mMSY_{r}}}\\
    |{mMSY_{r}}-{C_{t}}|   &\quad \text{if }\ |{mMSY_{r}}-{C_{t}}| < {mMSY_{r}}\\
    {mMSY_{r}}                 &\quad \text{otherwise }
   \end{cases}
\]

\textit{How to calculate mMSY:}
How to calculate mMSY:

$$
B_{t+1} = B_{t} + rB_{t}(1 - \frac{B_{t}}{k}) - C_{t}
$$

$$
C_{t} = qB_{t}f_{t}
$$

$$
B_{t} = U_{t}/q
$$

$$
U_{t} = \frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}}
$$

$$
\frac{U_{t+1}}{q} = \frac{U_{t}}{q} + \frac{rU_{t}}{q[1-\frac{U_{t}}{Kq}]} - U_{t}{f_t}
$$

$$
\frac{U_{t+1}}{U_t} = r - \frac{rU_{t}}{Kq} - qf_{t}
$$

This equation can be converted to a linear regrssion model:
$$
Y = b_{o} + b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{2}
$$
$r$,$q$,$K$ values can be obtained by solving the linear regression, and thus $mMSY$

$$
mMSY = rK/4
$$
$$
mMSY_{r} = 0.75 * mMSY
$$
