# Summary of OHI+ Local Assessment

Ocean Health Index assessments at the global scale calculate scores for all coastal countries and territories and are led by Halpern *et al*. Independent assessments ('OHI+') are led by groups interested in calculating OHI scores for smaller areas, generally within one country or cluster of neighboring countries.

OHI+ scores are calculated based on the best available local information, which is incorporated as inputs, goal models, and reference points. The purpose of OHI+ assessments is to customize the OHI framework methodology to best represent the local context being assessed, which can mean different visions of what a healthy ocean is and what it should provide. This makes OHI+ scores not directly comparable to scores calculated in the global assessments, which are based on coarser-scale information, models, and reference points. Direct, quantitative comparison of scores China with scores from other assessments is limited, as methods used in different locations may reflect different objectives or assumptions, for example by attributing more or less weight to different goals, thereby representing different visions of a healthy ocean and different expectations of what it should provide. Nevertheless, the use of a consistent framework for all OHI assessments conducted permits qualitative comparisons to be made, for example that one location is closer to achieving its stated management targets than another is. Therefore, a table comparing scores can help identify which goal scores and therefore which methodolgies differed the most between the assessments. Because of the local information included, OHI+ assessments should be used for within-country decision making, and global scores should be used to compare global comparisons.
