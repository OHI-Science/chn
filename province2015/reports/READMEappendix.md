## Goal model description and reference points

(sub)goal | OHI global assessment | OHI+ China assessment | 
----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
fisheries | status model is based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, which is the estimated population biomass (B) relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for each landed stock (B<sub>MSY</sub>). B<sub>MSY</sub> is calculated with a single-species MSY reference point, with the assumption that this value is sustainable. Regions are penalized for both underharvest and overharvest (more severely). | The same sataus model and reference point are used as in the 2012 Global assessment. China incorporated local, province-level harvest data to reveal finer differences among provinces. However, MSY was estimated based on total, non-species-specific harvest, using Walters & Hilborn (1976) non-equilibirium model since species-specific yield data was not available. Furthermore, harvest data were reported by each fishing boat, which often fishes across provincial boundaries and outside of the EEZ. Current data thus might not reflect the best regional differences, and may exceed actual harvest levels within the EEZ. |
mariculture | status model is based on tonnes of harvest of mariculture species per coastal inhabitant (with coastal defined as within 25 km inland). The spatial reference point is the region with the highest value, with the assumption that production depends on the presence of coastal communities that can provide the labor force, infrastructures, and economic demand to support the development and economic viability of mariculture facilities. | The same model and reference point approaches in the 2012 global assessment were used, but better information on physical limitations of mariture was available to the China study. The Chinese government has identified suitable areas for maricutlure and assessments were done only within those areas. This approach provides a more realistic picture of the status of mariculture than if we used a broader coastal land boundary. Currently Maricutlure Sustainability Index (MSI) values were obtained from the global study. More data on water quality standards and food sources (eg. species, origin, etc) will help determine the sustainability of mariculture.  |
artisanal fishing opportunities | status model is based on the demand for artisanal fishing, estimated using indirect measures of poverty measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Supply was estimated using an indicator ranking how well regions regulated and supported artisanal fishing, and did not incorporate a measure of the health of the targeted species or of sustainability of the fishing practices.The reference point is that all demand for artisanal fishing is achieved and that the fishing is done in a way that doesn't compromise future fishing resources. | Data on poverty measurements is not available in China. We followed the example of West Coast study in 2014 and developed the status model based on the three indicators: capcacity for exports, measured by the number of ports; the need for artisanal fishing opportunities, represented by the number of artisanal fishermen; economic capacity, measured by the ratio of diesel price and disposable income. For each indicator, the spatial reference point is the maximum value across all region and all years. |
natural products | status model is based on the most recent harvest of each product per region relative to a fraction of the maximum value ever achieved in that region, with the assumption that the previous maximum achieved was the maximum possible. | The same status model is used here. Three natural resources were assessed: sea salt, chemical products, and bio-pharmaceuticals. Reference point was selected differently. Instead of using the maximum production level, the 5-year average was used instead. Although it is not an ideal reference point and resulted in high scores in many regions, each region has its own reference point, which reflects  | 
coastal protection | status model is based on the amount and/or condition (depending on data availability) of marine habitat(s) and their ranked protective ability of each habitat type to protect the coast relative to their reference states in the early 1980's. | The status model is the same as the 2012 Global model. Four habitats were measured: mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, and coral reef, which they provide the most coastal protection and have available data. Not all habitat exist in all provinces and time series of extent data was poor for some. A temporal Reference point for each habitat was set to its condition in 1980's. Time-series data on condition of each habitat was not obtainable. However, rough estimate of relative change in coverage areas since the 1980's was found in literature. |
carbon storage | status model is based on the amount and/or condition (depending on data availability) of marine habitat(s) and their relative contribution to total carbon storage relative to their reference states in the early 1980's. Relative contribution was indirectly measured as the amount of area each habitat covers relative to the total area covered by all three habitats given the available data.  | In addition to using the amount of area each habitat covers, relative rate of carbon storage of each habitat was added to better measure relative carbon storage contribution. A temporal Reference point for each habitat was set to its condition in 1980's. Time-series data on condition of each habitat was not obtainable. However, rough estimate of relative change in coverage areas since the 1980's was found in literature. |
clean waters | status model is based on categories of pollution: eutrophication/nutrients, chemicals, pathogens and marine debris. The reference point is that waters are free from all pollution. |Due to unavailability of data on pathogens and marine debris, we used nitrogen, phosphate, chemical oxygen demand, and petroleum pollution as indicators of water quality. |
tourism and recreation | status model is based on the proportion of direct employment in the tourism industry relative to total labor force as an indirect measure for the total number of people engaged in coastal tourism and recreation activities. The reference point was the region with the highest ratio, under the assumption that all regions would in fact want a higher proportion in this industry. | Our model is based on the ratio of visitors and coastal area. The number of visitors included both domestic and international visitors. Travel and Touisms Competitive Index (TTCI) was also considered and we used the same data as the 2012 global study due to a lack of local assessment of the index. The spatial reference point was the region with the highest ratio across all years. |
livelihoods | status model is based on the number of direct and indirect jobs across marine sectors within a region and the average wages within each sector. Jobs has a moving target temporal reference point; the objective of the jobs component is no loss of jobs and they must keep pace with growth in employment rates or sustain losses no greater than national increases in unemployment rates. Wages has a spatial reference point, which is determined from the region with the highest average wages across all sectors. | The status model was kept the same as the 2012 global study. However, due to unavailability of wage information per sector, wage was substituted by average disposable income among rural and urban inhabitants in the coastal region. Eleven marine sectors were incorporated in our assessment. The number of jobs per sector was not readily available and was extenuated from the nation-wide number of employments per sector and total number of marine-related jobs per province. Both jobs and wages have a spatial reference point of the maximum value among all provinces across all years. |
economies | status model is based on the total revenue generated directly and indirectly from each marine sector. The reference point was a moving target temporal comparison, with a correction based on a region's GDP so that revenue kept pace with growth in GDP or sustained losses comparable to national declines in GDP. | Status model was kept the same as in the 2012 global assessment. Data on revenue generated from each marine sector was not avaialbe, and thus total revenue from all sectors were used directly for the assessment. A spatial reference point was the maximum revenue across all years. |
iconic species | status model is based on the average extinction risk of identified iconic species, calculated as the weighted sum of the number of species in each threat category, where an increasing weight is assigned by level of extinction risk of the threat category. The reference point is to have the risk status of all iconic species at lowest risk of extinction. | The same status model and reference point were used. However, data was localized by including species listed in China's List of Protected Species. |
lasting special places | status model is based on the percent of coastal waters that are special, measured by coastal marine protected areas and the percent of public or protected land along the coast. Both sea and land components are compared to a reference point of 30% protection. (2014?)  | The status model was developed based on the 2012 global assessment, however, only coastal marine protected areas was considers, as protected coastline information was not available. The reference point was reduced to 5%, which is the goal set by national marine protection policies to achieve by 2020. |
habitats | status model is based on the amount and/or condition (depending on data availability) of marine habitat(s) relative to their reference states in the early 1980's. | The same status model was used as in the 2012 global assessment. Three types of habitats were assessed: seagrassed, saltmarsh, and mangroves. Temporal reference point was their reference states in the early 1980's. |
species | status model is based on the average extinction risk of all assessed species, calculated as the weighted sum of area and the number of species in each threat category, where an increasing weight is assigned by level of extinction risk of the threat category. The reference point is to have the risk status of all assessed species at lowest risk of extinction. | Becuase area data was not obtainable, average extinction risk of all assessed species was calculated as the weighted sum of the number of species in each threat category only. The reference point was set the same as in the global assessment. |
